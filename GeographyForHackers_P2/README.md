###P2 - Using QGIS for Analysis

This section takes the fundamentals of geography and cartography from P1 and allows you to apply them within the QGIS spatial analysis software. [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) is an Open Source project that allows us to create, edit, visualize, analyze, and publish spatial data in a variety of ways. We will go over topics such as installation, graphical user interface (GUI), plugins, and tool sets. We will then walk through the process of analyzing both vector and raster data sets.

The materials for this class are from the [FOSS4G GeoAcademy](http://spatialquerylab.com/foss4g-academy-curriculum/) (click on the GitHub link for the lab data). Due to the length of this section, we will only be working with portions of this curriculum, but I encourage you to go through all of the labs following the class.
