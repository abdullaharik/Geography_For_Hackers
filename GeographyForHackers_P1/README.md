# P1 - Introduction to Geography and GIS

This is the most important section of this course! We begin with a brief history to show the extreme relevance of geography in the world. We then explore fundamental concepts that compose the field of geography and how that relates the more technical fields of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and GIScience. The remainder of this section is dedicated to exploring the art and science of making maps, better known as cartography. With the advent of the Internet, many applications have changed how we view maps. This review of cartographic principles will aid in understanding how one takes a 3D Earth and represents it as accurately as possible in a 2D, 2.5D, and/or 3D medium. We will wrap up by reviewing several different types of maps, their standards, and their intended functions.
